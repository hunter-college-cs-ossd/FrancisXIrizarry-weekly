# Endeavour

Well, we've reached the final week. Long time coming, and long time passed. Unfortunately, I don't have much to offer in these final moments. I had tried to resolve an issue (regarding text box issues, tooltips, etc.); however, I was told my solution was incorrect and that another person was closer to a correct solution; however, [Same issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/24374) had occurred. It seems someone basically did the same thing I did, and have not been told their solution is incorrect. Not sure how to take this.
