# Week 14

## December 19

# Endeavour

Well, we've reached the final week. Long time coming, and long time passed. Unfortunately, I don't have much to offer in these final moments. I had tried to resolve an issue (regarding text box issues, tooltips, etc.); however, I was told my solution was incorrect and that another person was closer to a correct solution; however, [Same issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/24374) had occurred. It seems someone basically did the same thing I did, and have not been told their solution is incorrect. Not sure how to take this.

Moving on, I began looking at the solution the other individual in the original thread gave; however, Jessica suggested that she should take the lead on it, in which, she's been working on a similar problem as the problem solution given was not very robust. Unfortuantely thereafter I began looking into solving other issues on godot; however, a majority of them are seemingly too complex, and too deep to get into with the last week or so (including my various other projects). Other ones I was looking into were:

However, it is clear that I have not made much progress with any of these issues. I had began alterting the method to handle PoolVector; however, functionality outside the class keeps over-riding the changes and I have been unable to identify the issue: [Issue being referred to](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/18328)

All in all, while I got to experience a lot of code built together I believe there are better projects out there that offer a lot more ability and range to contribute. This is my ***final post***. I unfortunately did not get to submit a pull request that was accepted; however, at least I got the experience of failure and of trying!
