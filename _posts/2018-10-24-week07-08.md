## Assignment 9:

# Bug Tracker Assignment 1.

# Objective 

The focus of bug-tracker 1 was to look at GNOME's bugzilla bug tracker. The whole premise behind this was to get our feet wet into seeing a system dedicated to bug tracking (In this case GNOME which is a free and open source project to create a desktop environment for Linux). The project is fine, decently active. There were a significant amount of bug reports being opened, assigned, and closed within a single week. The amount of contributors is not unrealistically high; however, there are only a select few who are putting in a majority of work regarding a significant amount of the bugs currently involved in this project. Finally, I found it really easy to get the information regarding the report system, help system, bug-tracking system, and analytical data. I believe it took me about 15-25 minutes at most to complete the entire posts and gather information; however, I do have to hand it to GNOME for having a lot of information on their page, it was a little much to read through everything but was interesting (Skimmed, not actually throughly read through). 

Overall: 7/10
