According to scott there are individuals who seem to have issues with the idea of the name of master being named develop (Very petty things; however, I can see the issues). Scott delves into the idea that git-flow is usually more than what is required for most teams. Github themselves instead use Flow as git-flow focuses on release based development while github focuses on consistent, daily updates - One of the thoughts behind this process is that a significant amount of issues can be avoided (Such as large scale bugs, random hot-fixes, etc.) as by developing often allows them to catch bugs, and are unlikely to create bigger ones. The method that flow follows is the following:
1) Anything in master branch can be deployed
2) New development gets a new branch *Considered the "hard rule" of the system*
3) Commit to that branch locally
4) Open pull request when ready
5) Merge after confirmation
6) Once merged, deployment _should_ occur

^ All of these processes have been accomplished by most if not all members of this open-source group; therefore, I do not desire to explain them in detail; however a general analysis is the following:
git branch "name"
git checkout "name"
git add "files/."
git commit "Message"
git push origin (empty/branch/project url) (master)
git request-pull (Version) (Project url) (master) or utilize github.com pull request tool
git merge -s ours branch or utilize github merge tool (after confirming/fixing conflictions)
then deploy.

Regarding project setup.

[IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=godotengine)  
[Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/)  
[Engine Development](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/introduction_to_godot_development.html)   
[KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org/download)  
[IDE Suggestions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/development/cpp/configuring_an_ide.html)  

To describe this process as "simple" would be decently accurate; however, there were a few issues I ran into when trying to setup this environment. I ran into an issue regarding the order in which operations needed to be done (I accidentally started by compiling and building for the general engine itself rather than the development; however, this proved to be required anyway.) The process to compile and to build took over half an hour to an hour to do, and then I spent my time fiddling around trying to get export templates working, which I did in the end successfully get working. Thereafter, I focused on getting KDevelop installed and functioning (the documentation regarding KDevelop 4 is not up to date, nor are the videos; however, I managed to assume some functionality without descriptions in which it seems functional). At this point it seems that everything is working (everything complies and the game engine itself boots correctly); therefore, I believe I am ready to start delving into issues.
