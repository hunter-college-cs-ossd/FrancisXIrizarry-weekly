# Quantum GIS (updated on 10/27/2018)

### 1. High Level Project Evaluation Criteria
  * Is it open source?
      * Yes
  * What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?
      * It has [GNU General Public License](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/appendices/appendices.html#gnu-general-public-license) and [GNU Free Documentation License](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/appendices/appendices.html#gnu-free-documentation-license)
        
  * How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?
      * This is a very active project, as far as I can see. People are actively submitting issues, having pull requests looked at, and being merged. 
  * How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat? 
      * The issue discussion on [issues.qgis.org](https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues) seems to be semi-active (Example of active chat: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/20276). However, they have a great discussions of [Pull Requests on GitHub](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls). The [IRC discussion](http://irclogs.geoapt.com/qgis/) also seens very helpful and friendy 
  * How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?
      * There are guides: [guides](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html) for anything you may need. They explain in quite the amount of detail regarding function naming, and class utilization. 
  * What programming languages are used in the project?
      *  C++, Python
  * What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?
      *  IDE is QtCreator. Seems simple enough to install, Their guide [*Getting up and running with QtCreator and QGIS*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/developers_guide/qtcreator.html#setting-your-run-environment) and [*Getting Started*](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) include information on how to install the environment.
  * How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?
      * Relatively simple, they have `.h` and `.cpp` files always in pairs, the `.h` is well documented, and `.cpp` is very clear: the variables, classes, etc. are named appropriately, the code is understandable!  
  * Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?
      * No, it looks like that you don't need anything other than QGIS and QtCreateor.
  * How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?
      *  It's focused on user's interface and visualization.
  * How complicated is the code and how large is it?
      * It is a large project; however, given time the projects scope of understanding can be gained.
  * How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?
      * This project originated in 2002, and it has already released version 2.18 as of today. It is quite mature.
  * Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?
      * Most projects are interesting/excite me; however, I believe this one will be the easiest to work with thus far.

# Doxygen 

### Pre-Evaluation. Additional Questions

      * Code Lines :	279,317	
  * What percentage of the code is comments?
      * Percent Comment Lines :	15.6%
  * How many commits were made in the last 30 days, based on OpenHub statistics?
      * 43 commits in the last 30 days
  * Click on "User & Contributor Locations" (lower right side of screen). List some of the locations of
the developers.
      * The page hasn't loaded.

### 1. High Level Project Evaluation Criteria
  * Is it open source? 
      * It didn't necessarily state it was open source; however, since the code is public and has a lisence that allows for forks and modifications under GNU General Public Licence, I can assume that it is open source.
  * What is its license? Does the license allow for forks and modifications?
      * It has [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html), which allows for forks and modifications.
  * How active is this project? Are people actively submitting issues and are people closing issues in a
timely manner?
      * This project is decently active. They submit issues semi-often ranging from 3-7 days. The amount of time it takes to close issues are not consistent; however, most usually do get closed.
  * How welcoming does the community seem? Are people friendly in the issue discussions, the discussion
forum, and chat?
      * The community seems friendly; however, a majority of interactions occur with only one individual who does a great job participating in issue discussions and in pull request discussion.
  * How easy is it to find information about contributing to the project? Are there clear guides and
documentation that can help someone who wants to contribute? Are there written guides about rules
of conduct, for example? In short, is it an inviting project?
      * Information was easy to find, and can be found here: [Mannual](http://www.doxygen.org/manual/index.html),  this manual describes every step the developer needs to do. However, there is no rules of conduct. It is technically an inviting project; however, the interactions may not go so far. 
  * What programming languages are used in the project?
      * 87.6% of code is in C++.
  * What is the development environment, and how hard is it to download and install it?
      * Visual Studio 2013, Cygwin, or MinGW. Also you need to install modern versions of `bison`, `flex`, `python`, and `binaries`. Also, there are some additional things to install, which depend on what you want to do.
  * How hard is it to understand the project code? Is it a large code base?
      * It is a large project with minimal comments, it's not super simple to follow; however, you can still figure it out given time. 
  * Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as database or graphics libraries?
      * Doxygen comes as a self-installing archive so installation of the binaries is extremely simple.
  * How much does one need to know about the domain of the application in order to understand the
code? For example, if it is a health-related application, how much medical or biological background
would a contributor need?
      * It the developer want to modify parts that document the code, they need knowledge in terms of how the program runs, and what it's utilizing to do so. In this case Doxygen provides some [Articles](http://doxygen.org/articles.html) to read.
  * How complicated is the code and how large is it?
      * The code base is large, and somewhat complicated. While not impossible to comb through, it would take a significant amount of time. 
  * How mature is the project? Is it very new, or has it been around for a long time? Does it have a stable
release yet?
      * The first lines of source code were added to Doxygen in 1999. [Information here](http://doxygen.org/index.html).
  * Is the project interesting and/or exciting to you?
      * Personally, as I said before any project is _interesting_ to me; however, I believe this would be on the harder side of the select projects (prior to other input)

timely manner?
      * It is a very active project: people submit/change many issues per day, submit many commits per day, and issues close to almost every day.

forum, and chat?
      * They seem very active in terms of answering questions regarding the project and the people in the issue discussions are very direct.
