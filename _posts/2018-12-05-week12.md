# Week 12

## Blog Update


Basically this week was spent just working on other projects, and spending time doing work in my other classes. As for the original issue my group picked we unfortunately got no where with it. The issue vastly more complex than the individual who said they were close to a solution, and the method they had used was very inefficient and lazy. While is somewhat solved the problem that needed to be fixed it was designed to do so. They simply took functionality from another class that was designed specifically with the intention for that class. Therefore, we have begun working on a similar but less problematic problem regarding sprites in godot. It seems some progress is being made; however, we need to spend more time once classes end to really involve ourselves with the issues.
