## Assignment 8:

# Git-Exercise 2.

## Details

The goal of the exercise was to become more familiar with merging, pull requests and working as a team. There was a git-exercise-02 repository for each team member and each member had to create a function to output a different odd fact for each of the other members' main.cpp files. A pull request was then made to the repository's owner to be merged. While this was not exactly difficult, I did go ahead and make some additions that were not required because I figured it would be fun; however, I was quickly told to just follow the instructions given. 

## Opinion

The exercise was straightforward in terms of resolving merge conflicts and pull requests. It was fine, nothing too interesting nor challenging. Not many changes were made to the program between each person and that made merging much easier (Except what I did, which I did change.). 

Overall: 6/10
